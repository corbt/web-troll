		### Overview
		Trollie has a single API endpoint that can be used to access the reading-level engine.

		The endpoint is `/api/v1/[isbns]/reading_level`, and requires two parameters:
		
		* `isbns` one or more comma-separated ISBN-10 or ISBN-13s
		* `key` the API key encoded as a URL parameter 

		### Data returned
		The API will always return a JSON object reporting the status of the request.  For example:
		
			{
				"0723206481":{"reading_level":0.4,"calculation_status":2},
				"9780789414571":{"reading_level":6.1,"calculation_status":2},
				"1903845483":{"reading_level":4.6,"calculation_status":2}
			}

		Each requested ISBN is returned with a `calculation_status` field and a `reading_level` if available.

		#### Calculation Statuses
		* `1`: Reading level calculation in progress.  Continue polling.  (Reading levels take about a minute to calculate as a minimum and can take much longer if there are many books already in the queue.)
		* `2`: Reading level successfully calculated.  `reading_level` will contain the calculated number.
		* `3`: Error in reading level calculation.  This typically means that the algorithm was unable to find enough information to calculate a meaningful reading level.

		#### Errors
		In case of an error (`calculation_status: 3`), the server will return an `error` field containing further details.

		### Examples
		These sample requests demonstrate the functionality of the Trollie API.  "[your key]" must be replaced with a valid API key.

		#### Successful Request
		[#{isbn 9780757937064}](#{isbn 9780757937064})
		
			{"9780757937064":{"calculation_status":2,"reading_level":5.0}}

		#### Unregistered ISBN
		[#{isbn "0671707362"}](#{isbn "0671707362"})

			{"0671707362":{"calculation_status":3,"error":"No book was found on Openlibrary with this ISBN"}}

		#### Too-short ISBN
		[#{isbn 1234567}](#{isbn 1234567})

			{"1234567":{"calculation_status":3,"error":"Malformatted ISBN: ISBN must be 10- or 13-digit number"}}

		#### Multi-ISBN Request
		[#{isbns '0477072127,9780195866346,9780573693618,12345'}](#{isbns '0477072127,9780195866346,9780573693618,12345'})

			{
				"0477072127":{"calculation_status":1,"reading_level":null},
				"9780195866346":{"calculation_status":2,"reading_level":3.3},
				"9780573693618":{"calculation_status":2,"reading_level":4.4},
				"12345":{
					"calculation_status":3,
					"error":"Malformatted ISBN: ISBN must be 10- or 13-digit number"
				}
			}

		### Obtaining a Key
		There is currently no automatic way to obtain an API key.  If you'd like to use the service contact [Dr. Dennis Ng](mailto:ng@cs.byu.edu), professor of Computer Science at BYU, and we will facilitate the request.
